## Description

As 3 UW bootcamp students who have a lot of new content to memorize in such a short time, we needed a tool to help us attain the best recall accuracy while enabling us to do it in a fast and reliable way. We looked and found many available options online, however, most of them had lots of paywalls. Soon we realized that we could solve this problem by providing a simple, easy, and free “Leitner” box web app, to provide everyone with the tools needed to master their choice of content.
