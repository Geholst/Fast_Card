## Description

As 3 UW bootcamp students who have a lot of new content to memorize in such a short time, we needed a tool to help us attain the best recall accuracy while enabling us to do it in a fast and reliable way. We looked and found many available options online, however, most of them had lots of paywalls. Soon we realized that we could solve this problem by providing a simple, easy, and free “Leitner” box web app, to provide everyone with the tools needed to master their choice of content.

## Installation

Our app is deployed at https://fast-cards.herokuapp.com/. 

## Usage

A user can go to https://fast-cards.herokuapp.com/ and run through our sample deck to get an idea of how our site works. When you press start you are presented with a flashcard. You can press start on that and you are presented with a front side of a flashcard. If you press flip it will show the back of the flashcard with the answer. There is also a timer ascending for the duration you are practicing a flash card. You can choose how confident you are with that topic by choosing the color coded A,B,C,D. If you chhose A you are the most confident on that subject and it is put in the monthly review. B is semi-confident, and will be put in the weekly review. C is less confident and will be put in the Alternate Days review. D is not confident and is put in the daily review.
